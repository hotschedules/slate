#Working with HotSchedules data

####Making a call
**Note:** If your **namespace** has been created under the new IDM model, you will not have the ability to make calls using **api.hotschedules.io**. Please refer to the section on using Postman to make a call. You will need to have retrieved your JWT Token before you can use this method.

<br>
The HotSchedules REST API supports all the standard REST verbs.

**GET**  
**POST**  
**PUT**  
**PATCH**  
**DELETE**  

You can access these verbs for each of the types in the HotSchedules system. When an organization is created in the HotSchedules Platform, the organization automatically gets 32 'types' that will store standard information and data about your organization. Those 'types' can be viewed and reviewed at [https://api.hotschedules.io/apidocs/index.html](https://api.hotschedules.io/apidocs/index.html)

####GET
As an example, let's do a **GET** on a store via CURL
`curl -ik --cookie "RUSK=8a6f98bb1033055fc04d644c0006789335f96c2b-username=platform" -X GET https://api.hotschedules.io/bodhi-social/resources/Store`

This call will return the information about a store that's been created for the bodhi-social organization
    
`[{"sys_version":1,"image_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Golden_Gate_Bridge_0002.jpg","sys_type_version":12,"address":{"street_address":"555 Mission","extended_address":"","locality":"San Francisco","region":"CA","postal_code":"94111","country":"US"},"store_hours":[{"days":[7,1],"start":"0500","end":"0000"},{"days":[1,2],"start":"1200","end":"0200"},{"days":[2,3],"start":"1200","end":"0200"},{"days":[3,4],"start":"1200","end":"0200"},{"days":[4,5],"start":"1200","end":"0200"},{"days":[5,6],"start":"1200","end":"0200"},{"days":[6,7],"start":"0500","end":"0000"}],"sys_created_by":"admin__bodhi-social","sys_created_at":"2016-05-21T15:37:15.560Z","name":"platformstore","store_number":"1","display_name":"Platform Store","sys_id":"574080abb9a19e2dadee775b"}]`

You can also get the JSON payload by navigating directly to this URL `https://api.hotschedules.io/bodhi-social/resources/Store`  

You can create your own store for your organization either by executing a **POST** command (see below) to `https://api.hotschedules.io/<organization_name>/resources/Store` or using our free store manager tool at `https://hotschedules.io/store-manager` . Either way, a store is a critical anchor for information in the Platform.

Next let's look up a sale for our store in bodhi-social

`curl -ik --cookie "RUSK=8a6f98bb1033055fc04d644c0006789335f96c2b-username=platform" -X GET https://api.hotschedules.io/bodhi-social/resources/SalesTransaction`

RESULT:

`[{"order_number":10184,"item_count":1,"store_id":"574080abb9a19e2dadee775b","employee":{"id":"5151","name":"Ted Morrison"},"business_day":"2016-05-20","revenue_center":{"id":"2","name":"Restaraunt"},"type":{"id":"4","name":"1"},"timestamp":"2016-05-21T03:34:00.000Z","transaction_id":"557605fc4c32e071180a46042016-05-2010184","net_total":{"value":325,"code":"USD","scale":2},"discount_total":{"value":0,"code":"USD","scale":2},"tax_total":{"value":23,"code":"USD","scale":2},"gross_total":{"value":348,"code":"USD","scale":2},"tender_total":{"value":348,"code":"USD","scale":2},"order_opened_at":"2016-05-21T03:33:00.000Z","order_closed_at":"2016-05-21T03:34:00.000Z","guest_count":1,"sys_version":1,"sys_created_at":"2016-05-21T16:02:30.800Z","sys_created_by":"admin__bodhi-social","sys_type_version":12,"sys_id":"574086965eacd06aa3db036b"}]`

We can also look up our Store using query parameters in our URL

`curl --cookie "RUSK=8a6f98bb1033055fc04d644c0006789335f96c2b-username=platform" 'https://api.hotschedules.io.io/bodhi-social/resources/SalesTransaction?where=%7Bbusiness_day:"2016-05-20"%7D&fields=business_day'`

OR alternatively:

`curl -g --cookie "RUSK=8a6f98bb1033055fc04d644c0006789335f96c2b-username=platform" 'https://api.hotschedules.io/bodhi-social/resources/SalesTransaction?where={business_day:"2016-05-20"}&fields=business_day'`

RESULT:    
`[{"order_number":10184,"item_count":1,"store_id":"574080abb9a19e2dadee775b","employee":{"id":"5151","name":"Ted Morrison"},"business_day":"2016-05-20","revenue_center":{"id":"2","name":"Restaraunt"},"type":{"id":"4","name":"1"},"timestamp":"2016-05-21T03:34:00.000Z","transaction_id":"557605fc4c32e071180a46042016-05-2010184","net_total":{"value":325,"code":"USD","scale":2},"discount_total":{"value":0,"code":"USD","scale":2},"tax_total":{"value":23,"code":"USD","scale":2},"gross_total":{"value":348,"code":"USD","scale":2},"tender_total":{"value":348,"code":"USD","scale":2},"order_opened_at":"2016-05-21T03:33:00.000Z","order_closed_at":"2016-05-21T03:34:00.000Z","guest_count":1,"sys_version":1,"sys_created_at":"2016-05-21T16:02:30.800Z","sys_created_by":"admin__bodhi-social","sys_type_version":12,"sys_id":"574086965eacd06aa3db036b"}]`

So `https://api.hotschedules.io/bodhi-social/resources/SalesTransaction?where={%27business_day%27:%272016-05-20%27}` would return all SalesTransaction's for the business day of 2016-05-20.
The URL `https://api.hotschedules.io/bodhi-social/resources/SalesTransaction?where={%27store_id%27:%27574080abb9a19e2dadee775b%27}` would return all SalesTransaction's for the store 574080abb9a19e2dadee775b (our Platform test store).

All Types can be queried by any parameter within the type using a ?where={} clause. It's **EXTREMELY** important for efficiency and performance to query using indexes on your types. You can review the Types for your organization as well as the Indexes and Parameters by using our free Type Tool located at `https://tools.hotschedules.io/types` or by inspecting `https://api.hotschedules.io/<organization_name>/resources/BodhiType`

####POST
To **POST** to a type you need to add the the header: 'Content-Type: application/json' to your cURL Command

`curl -ik -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --cookie "RUSK=8a6f98bb1033055fc04d644c0006789335f96c2b-username=foo" -X POST -d '{
  "store_id": "l8zeL",
  "business_day": "2016-05-13",
  "timestamp": "2016-05-12T05:58:31.296Z",
  "transaction_id": "FGHG012",
     "tender_total": {
      "code": "USD",
      "scale": 2,
      "value": 620
    }
}' https://api.hotschedules.io/<organization_name>/resources/SalesTransaction`

That command will post the json object to the SalesTransaction type. You can now GET on this type either using cURL or the free query tools available at https://tools.hotschedules.io/query

####Bulk Post
All bulk operations are accessible through https://api.hotschedules.io  
The size limitation for the body is 17MB  

###Syntax: 
**POST** `/<organization_name>/bulk` with json body  
```{
  "config": {
    "op": "insert" or "update" or "upsert" or "invite",  * see below
     "report": true,        <- optional, need a report? (default false) 
     "target": "target_name”    <- the name of the type (not for invite)
  },
  "payload": [{
    "the_field": "my first thing to insert or upsert or invite",
    "other_field": "the_other_field"
  }, {
    "the_field": "my second thing to insert or upsert",
    "other_field": "the_other_field2"
  }]
}```  

The payload varies depending on the type of operation and Returns 202 with header `bulk_id:<the bulk id>`

The result of a report, if requested, is accessible as soon as the processing is done on:

**GET** `/<organization_name>/bulk/<bulk_id>`

**RESPONSE:**  
returns **200** with a json array body where the order of the cells matches the order of the payload. The report can be accessed only once.  
returns **204** if the report is not ready yet  
returns **404** if no report was found with that id  

  * update/upsert is only available for types not encapsulated 
  * insert on system types only BodhiUser, BodhiType and BodhiEnumeration and any not encapsulated type

###Example:
```{
  "config": {
    "op": "insert",
    "report": true,
    "target":  "BulkTest"
  },
  "payload": [{
    "name": "leo",
    "other_field": "mauris non"
  }, {
    "name": "orci",
    "other_field": "sit amet justo"
  }, {
    "name": "nulla",
    "other_field": "pulvinar sed nisl nunc rhoncus"
  }, {
    "name": "nulla",
    "other_field": "diam cras"
  }, {
    "name": "est",
    "other_field": "dui nec nisi volutpat"
  }, {
    "name": "lorem",
    "other_field": "cursus id"
  }, {
    "name": "molestie",
    "other_field": "potenti nullam porttitor lacus at"
  }, {
    "name": "sapien",
    "other_field": "ultrices aliquet maecenas leo"
  }, {
    "name": "nibh",
    "other_field": "consectetuer eget rutrum at"
  }, {
    "name": "luctus",
    "other_field": "nisl nunc"
  }]
}```

####PUT
The HTTP verb PUT can be used on any type as long as there's a unique index on the field or fields. You can always PUT on sys_id

As an example, in the above SalesTransaction example, the sys_id is 574086965eacd06aa3db036b, a PUT to the SalesTransaction based on sys_id would be as follows:

`
curl -ik -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --cookie "RUSK=8a6f98bb1033055fc04d644c0006789335f96c2b-username=foo" -X PUT -d '{ "store_id": "l8zeL", "business_day": "2016-05-13", "timestamp": "2016-05-12T05:58:31.296Z", "transaction_id": "FGHG012", "tender_total": { "code": "USD", "scale": 2, "value": 620 } }' https://api.hotschedules.io/tutorial/resources/SalesTransaction/574086965eacd06aa3db036b
` 

####PUT Upsert
Upsert is a safe way to replace an existing record, or POST a record if the entry does not currently exist.

You can upsert by appending your URL with ?upsert=true

As an example, the above PUT example can be changed to a replace by appending the ?upsert=true to the cURL command:

`
curl -ik -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --cookie "RUSK=8a6f98bb1033055fc04d644c0006789335f96c2b-username=foo" -X PUT -d '{ "store_id": "l8zeL", "business_day": "2016-05-13", "timestamp": "2016-05-12T05:58:31.296Z", "transaction_id": "FGHG012", "tender_total": { "code": "USD", "scale": 2, "value": 620 } }' https://api.hotschedules.io/tutorial/resources/SalesTransaction/574086965eacd06aa3db036b?upsert=true
`


####PATCH
the HTTP verb PATCH will allow you to alter single parameters or fields within a record in your type. Patch commands follow the following sytax:
[ { "op": "replace", "path": "/baz", "value": "boo" }, { "op": "add", "path": "/hello", "value": ["world"] }, { "op": "remove", "path": "/foo"} ]

The HTTP verb PATCH can be used on any type as long as there's a unique index on the field or fields. You can always PATCH on sys_id

####DELETE
the HTTP verb DELETE will allow you to remove a record in your type. To delete multiple records, include a ?where={} in your URL to narrow or expand then number of records removed.

####File Upload
The Platform BodhiFileUpload endpoints are special types that allow a user to upload and download any file (like a dbf file from your store's POS).

Metadata of your file is posted to type BodhiFileUpload on successful upload  

**BodhiFileUpload example record:**  
`{ "namespace": "bodhi", "original_name": "profile_pic5.jpg", "sys_version": 1, "location": "bodhi/profile_pic5.jpg", "uploaded_at": "2015-09-10T19:42:48+0000", "sys_created_by": "admin__bodhi", "sys_created_at": "2015-09-10T19:42:49+0000", "name": "profile_pic5.jpg", "media_type": "image/jpeg", "sys_id": "55f1dd39b9b5904f64c8212f" }`

**Examples:**  
The following are curl examples of how to specify file location in your upload/download/delete commands.  Everything after “upload/” or “download/” in the url is used as the destination.  Note that filename is always specified in the url.  

`curl -X POST -u <username>:<password> https://api.hotschedules.io/<organization_name>/controllers/vertx/upload/recipes/food/BurritoRecipe.txt -F "upload1=@THE_FILE"`  

`curl -X PUT -u <username>:<password> https://api.hotschedules.io/<organization_name>/controllers/vertx/upload/recipes/food/BurritoRecipe.txt -F "upload1=@THE_FILE"`

**Download by path:**  
`curl -X GET -u <username>:<password> https://api.hotschedules.io/<organization_name>/controllers/vertx/download/recipes/food/BurritoRecipe.txt`

**Download by sys_id:**  
`curl -X GET -u <username>:<password> https://api.hotschedules.io/<organization_name>/controllers/vertx/download/56f9c2b4fa92ec27934a76ae`  

**Delete a file:**  
`curl -X DELETE -u <username>:<password> https://api.hotschedules.io/<organization_name>/controllers/vertx/upload/recipes/food/BurritoRecipe.txt`

#Using Postman To Make a Call

Postman makes API development faster, easier, and better. Postman is the most complete toolchain for API development. The most-used REST client worldwide. Designed from the ground up to support the API developer. Intuitive user interface to send requests, save responses, add tests, and create workflows Read the docs.

You can make calls using both Basic Authentication using your HotSchedules IoT Platform account credentials (username and password) and the JWT Token method.

We have created a Postman collection to enable you with making calls to the REST API.

<div id="btn" style="padding-left: 30px;">
<div class="postman-run-button"
data-postman-action="collection/import"
data-postman-var-1="caea705a1c30e38ea420"></div></div>


<script type="text/javascript">
  (function (p,o,s,t,m,a,n) {
    !p[s] && (p[s] = function () { (p[t] || (p[t] = [])).push(arguments); });
    !o.getElementById(s+t) && o.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild((
      (n = o.createElement("script")),
      (n.id = s+t), (n.async = 1), (n.src = m), n
    ));
  }(window, document, "_pm", "PostmanRunObject", "https://run.pstmn.io/button.js"));
</script>


**Basic Authentication Example:** Let's do a Basic Authentication call to getEmpInfo. This method takes in a concept ID and a store ID and returns an array of wsEmpInfo objects. It is meant to get a list of all employees for that store.

<br>

**1.** Create a new Request in Postman and name it **'Get Employee Info'**.

![alt text](/images/pms1.png?raw=false "Step 1")

**2.** Set the request type to **'GET'** and enter the following URL.
__https://api.hotschedules.io/YOURNAMESPACE/controllers/vertx/hotschedules/YOURCONCEPTID/YOURSTORENUMBER/getEmpInfo?active_only=true__
  
  - Replace the **'YOURNAMESPACE'**, **'YOURCONCEPTID'** and **'YOURSTORENUMBER'** with your values.

![alt text](/images/pms2.png?raw=false "Step 2")

**3.** Select **'Basic Auth'** in the Authorization section and enter your username and password.

![alt text](/images/pms3.png?raw=false "Step 3")
![alt text](/images/pms3a.png?raw=false "Step 3")


**4.** Push the **'Send'** button to make the call and review the response in the **'Body'** section.

![alt text](/images/pms4.png?raw=false "Step 4")

**5.** Save the request so you can refer back and make repetitive calls to update the response.

<br><br>

**NOTE: Completing the step of [retrieving your JWT Token](#idm-how-to-programatically-retrieve-jwt-tokens) is required before you can utilize the following example to make a call to the API with your JWT Token.**

**JWT Token Example:** To perform a call using this method, follow the same steps as the Basic Authentication method with the exception of Step 3. Select **'Bearer Token'** as the Authorization type and enter the bearer token you received when you performed the 'Retrieve JWT Token' call.


![alt text](/images/pms5.png?raw=false "Bearer Token")

#### setVolumeCountsV2

This method takes in a **concept ID**, **store ID**, **business date**, **date time**, **volume amount**, **volume type**, and a **revenue center** for the purpose of submitting actual volume drivers to HotSchedules from a third party system or point of sale. Using the authentication from the username token and the concept and store IDs, the server will resolve which HotSchedules client this sync is for. The array contains volume driver counts for a range of dates, corresponding to the start and end dates. The server-side logic can handle overlapping data (i.e. if you sync 7 days worth of time cards, every day, 6 days of it will be "overlapping" data) and will insert and update data as needed. If the guest are already in the HS database and do not need to be updated, then nothing will change. This method returns a WSReturn object.
